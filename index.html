        <p><em>Medical Professional and Aspiring Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>My name is Megan and I am 30 years old. I have been working in health care for the past 10 years and have had several different positions within the industry. I have been an advanced patient care technician,an EKG and stress lab technician, a medical assistant, and a cardiac monitor technician. Around the time when Covid hit and all the lockdowns were in place, I (like everyone else) was stuck in my apartment, aside from going work. I became more curious about my creative side and began to paint and draw. I later was introduced to the Adobe software and all that it had to offer. I had so many ideas but so little skill and knowledge on how to use this technology. I got eventually got overwhelmed and put it on the back burner for several years. Fast forward to 2022, I now wanted to learn how to create interactive apps and websites, but again was clueless on how. I found some apps that seemed to make it easy to try and create apps, but I grew overwheled with all the tools, and frustrated when I ran into problems I couldn't figure out. I hate having to stop every few steps just to learn something short and simple. I started to realize that I may be better off taking a that taught me how to code myself, instead of finding apps to do it for me. Although it's not the quickest route, I would rather learn how to solve most obsticales I run into instead of having to always ask someone and wait for a response. So I youtubed different ways to become a developer and chose the self-teaching route. I then used one of the websites that a developer/youtuber recommended for this type of course, which was Udemy. I am now taking "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Angela Yu, and feel like I am already learing so much. I am excited to see what I am able to do when I finish the course, and also excited to step into a new career field.  </p>
